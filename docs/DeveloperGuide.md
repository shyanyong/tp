## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="600" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PrescriptionListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `PrescriptionListParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a prescription).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `PrescriptionListParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `BayMedsParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="650" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the BayMeds data i.e., all `Prescription` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePrescriptionList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Prescription` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Prescription>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both BayMeds data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `Storage` and `UserPrefsStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### UI

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` component that serves as the parent for other JavaFX components as explained [here](#ui-component).

Upon initialising BayMeds for the first time, `UIManager` will call the `fillInnerParts` method of `MainWindow` which also executes the `scaleScreen` method to scale the UI according to the user's screen size.

The screen size is scaled strictly by **height** based on a 16:9 aspect ratio. The final size will then be saved in `preferences.json`.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Resizing the UI**

* The UI is made to not be resizable. As the window size is scaled according to the user's screen size when they open BayMeds for the first time, there will be no issues with inappropriate sizes for different screen resolutions.
* This ensures that the different UI components remain in full visibility at all times, thus keeping a simple and lightweight UX.
* The UI can still be minimized if need be, but there is no incentive to keep it running in the background. Users should ideally just need to open BayMeds, enter a few commands and exit.

### Add feature

The add prescription feature is facilitated by the `AddCommandParser`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add prescription mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user types the command `add mn/Propranolol`. Upon pressing enter, the `Ui` triggers the `execute` method in `Logic`, passing the input text to the `PrescriptionListparser` in `Logic`. The `PrescriptionListParser` then checks the command type to determine which command parser to call.

Step 2. Upon checking that it is an `add` command, the `AddCommandParser` will be created to `parse` the input text. It creates an `argMultiMap`, which contains the mappings of each recognised prefix in the input text, and its associated value.

**Note:** If there are absent prefixes that are compulsory, it will throw a `ParseException` error.

Step 3. The `AddCommandParser` will then create a new `Prescription` object using the `argMultiMap` with the prefix fields and values present. Optional fields which were not provided will be initialised as `null`. The `AddCommandParser` subsequently returns a new `AddCommand` object with the prescription to be added stored as an attribute.

**Note:** For the prescription's `startDate`, it will be initialised to `LocalDate.now()` if no start date is given, using the date of creation as the default `startDate` value.

Step 4: `Logic` then calls `AddCommand`'s `execute`. This will call `Model`'s `addPrescription` method, passing the prescription to be added. The `Model` will interact with the in-memory `PrescriptionList`, adding the prescription into it. Finally, the `Model` sets the `filteredPrescriptions` to show all prescriptions in the existing `PrescriptionList`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `add` operation works.

<puml src="diagrams/AddCommandSequenceDiagram.puml" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when the user executes an `add` command.

<puml src="diagrams/AddCommandActivityDiagram.puml" height="400" />

Design considerations:

Prescriptions may have an uneven consumption interval. For example, some prescriptions only needs to be consumed every Wednesday and Sunday. In such scenarios, users will need to input this prescription as 2 separate inputs with the same prescription name.

To cater for this, we are using every prescription's `name` and `startDate` to identify each prescription. Every `Prescription` must therefore have both these fields. As such, if no start date was provided, it will be initialised to a default value.

To cater to fast typists, we have made most of the input fields optional, so that they only need to put in minimal data in order to successfully add a prescription. The only compulsory field is the medication name of the prescription.

### Edit feature
The Edit Command is a fundamental feature of the BayMeds application, allowing users to modify the details of a prescription. It leverages the `EditPrescriptionDescriptor` and follows a specific edit mechanism.

#### `EditPrescriptionDescriptor`

The `EditPrescriptionDescriptor` is a crucial component for processing edit commands. It serves as a container for holding the new values that the user wishes to apply during the edit operation. This descriptor is essential for maintaining consistency and ensuring that only valid changes are made to a prescription.

The following class diagram shows the relationship between the `EditPrescriptionDescriptor` and the `EditCommand` class.

<puml src="diagrams/EditCommandClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

Shown is an example of the usage of the edit command, which shows the EditPrescriptionDescriptor in action.

Step 1. User initiates an edit command, e.g., `edit 1 mn/UpdatedMedicationName d/3`.

Step 2. The `EditCommandParser` processes the user's input, extracting the prescription index and the edits to be made.

Step 3. The `EditCommandParser` then creates an instance of the `EditPrescriptionDescriptor`, populating it with the provided changes. In the example above, the medication name (`mn`) is updated to "UpdatedMedicationName," and the dosage (`d`) is updated to "3".

Step 4. The `EditCommandParser` then creates an instance of the `EditCommand` class, passing in the prescription index and the `EditPrescriptionDescriptor` instance.

Step 5. The `EditCommand` class then calls the `execute` method, which carries out checks to ensure that the prescription index is valid. If the prescription index is invalid, an error message is returned to the user.

Step 6. The 'EditCommand' class uses the `EditPrescriptionDescriptor` instance and the Prescription to be edited to create a new Prescription with the edited fields.

Step 7. The edited prescription is then checked to ensure that it is valid. If the edited prescription is invalid, an error message is returned to the user.

Step 8. The `EditCommand` class then calls the `editPrescription` method in the `Model` class, passing in the prescription index and the edited prescription.






### Take / untake feature

**Note:** The untake feature is similar to the take feature but reverses the incrementing and decrementing of consumption count and stock respectively, given below is the guide for the take feature.

The take prescription feature is facilitated by the `TakeCommandParser`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the take prescription mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user types the command `take 1 d/4`. Upon pressing enter, the `Ui` triggers the `execute` method in `Logic`, passing the input text to the `PrescriptionListparser` in `Logic`. The `PrescriptionListParser` then checks the command type to determine which command parser to call.

Step 2. Upon checking that it is a `take` command, the `TakeCommandParser` will be created to `parse` the input text. It creates an `argMultiMap`, which contains the mappings of each recognised prefix in the input text, and its associated value.

**Note:** If no dosage is specified, the default dosage to take will be 1.

Step 3. The `TakeCommandParser` subsequently returns a new `TakeCommand` object with the index of the prescription to take and the dosage to take.

Step 4: `Logic` then calls `TakeCommand`'s `execute`. This will call `Model`'s `getFilteredPrescriptionList` method and retrieve the prescription based on the index from the in-memory `PrescriptionList`, necessary checks are done to check if the index is valid and there is enough stock.
`TakeCommand`'s executeTake is then called, incrementing the consumption count and decrementing the stock of the prescription. Finally, the completed status is set based on the consumption count and dosage of the prescription and the `Model` sets the `filteredPrescriptions` to show the prescription that was just taken from.

The following class diagram shows the classes associated with executing a take command.

<puml src="diagrams/TakeCommandClassDiagram.puml" />

Design considerations:

Prescriptions may have duplicate names but different start dates.

To cater for this, the take command uses the index instead of the name of the medication when executing.


### List today feature

The list today feature is facilitated by the `ListTodayCommandParser`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the list today mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. `Ui` and `Logic` works similarly to when [adding prescriptions](#add-feature). However, a `ListTodayCommandParser` is created instead.

**Note:** If there are extra fields in the input, it will throw a `ParseException` error.

Step 2. The `ListTodayCommandParser` subsequently returns a new `ListTodayCommand` object.

Step 3: `Logic` then calls `ListTodayCommand`'s `execute`. This will create a new `IsTodayPredicate` object which is passed into the method call for `Model`'s `updateFilteredPrescriptionList`.

Step 4: The `Model` will then update the in-memory `FilteredList<Prescription>` with the new predicate. Finally, the `Model` sets the `filteredPrescriptions` to show only today's prescription in the existing `PrescriptionList`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `listToday` operation works.

<puml src="diagrams/ListTodayCommandSequenceDiagram.puml" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when the user executes an `listToday` command.

<puml src="diagrams/ListTodayCommandActivityDiagram.puml" height="400" />

Design considerations:

As there are no input parameters for `ListTodayCommand`, it is possible to implement this without `ListTodayCommandParser`. However, `ListTodayCommandParser` was created to utilise methods in `argMultiMap` to check for extra fields.

The result of `IsTodayPredicate` depends on the prescription's `startDate`. It is intentional that monthly frequencies are based on increments of 30 days rather than the absolute day of each month.

### List completed feature

To allow BayMeds to store a separate list of completed prescriptions to facilitate the `listCompleted` feature, we have expanded on the existing model and storage components.

Model also has an in-memory view of a `completedPrescriptionList`. It has its own set of CRUD features for handling `completedPrescriptionList`, and it handles `completedPrescriptionList` similar to how it handles `prescriptionList`.

Storage also contains the implementation of the `completedPrescriptionList` storage. The completed prescription list is stored in the file path `data/completedPrescriptionList.json`, adjacent to the storage for `prescriptionList`.

### Check prescription interaction feature

The check prescription interaction feature is facilitated by the `AddCommandParser`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the check prescription interaction mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. `Ui` and `Logic` works similarly to when [adding prescriptions](#add-feature). It creates an `argMultiMap`, which contains the mappings of each recognised prefix in the input text, and its associated value.

**Note:** If there are extra fields in the input, it will throw a `ParseException` error.

Step 2. The `AddCommandParser` subsequently returns a new `AddCommand` object.

Step 3: `Logic` then calls `AddCommand`'s `execute`. The ModelManager will check through the Prescriptions in the PrescriptionList to ensure that there are no clashing Drugs.

**Note:** If the prescription to be added contains a drug that will clash with an existing prescription, an warning message is returned to the user. The prescription will still be added.

Step 4: The `Model` will then update the in-memory `FilteredList<Prescription>` with the new drugs.

The following object oriented domain model shows the class structure of the problem domain.
